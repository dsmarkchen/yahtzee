# Yahtzee

This is my attempt to program Yahtzee game.

Below are my rules (Object Calisthenics) 

1. Use only one level of indentation per method
2. Don’t use the else keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and strings
4. Use first-class collections
5. Don’t abbreviate
6. Keep all entities small (<50 lines)
7. Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables
8. Use only one dot per line
9. Don’t use any getters/setters/properties
